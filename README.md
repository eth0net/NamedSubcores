Track which unfortunate pawn your subcores came from!

This mod was inspired by the wonderful Mr Samuel Streamer and his Biotech series!

Only new subcores can be tracked, as there is no way to find data for existing subcores or mechs, unfortunately.

This mod should be safe to add or remove from saves :D

Let me know if there are any bugs or requests, I'll happily do my best to fix them up!
