**This mod was inspired by the wonderful Mr Samuel Streamer and his Biotech series!**

## Features

- Subcores and mechs store info about scanned pawns
- Stored info: Title, Name, Faction, and Ideology
- Info is shown in the tooltip for subcores and mechs
- Scanning a pawn saves their info to the subcore
- Subcores from traders get random info generated
- Stored info is kept when disassembling mechs
- Info is 'Unknown' for existing or spawned subcores
